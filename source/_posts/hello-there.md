Hello! (From the other side)

Apologetic about the pathetic welcome. You will soon realise how hard it gets for me to resist my sad jokes.

Hi! I'm Sonal. I am a software engineer and a model - could feel the amazement and the disbelief in your heads right till here - totally novice in the blogging community and creativity is NOT my cup of tea. I spent nearly a month thinking about why I should start a blog and if I am doing this, what should my first post be, let alone blogging on a regular basis. Now as I start to type, I have a hell lot of things to tell you about myself and the blog but I am carefully trying not to overdo this lol.

So, replete with ideas and suggestions from my friends, it took me some time but I finally arrived at my disposition. Being an aspiring software developer, having a platform where I could share my experiences, works and interact with equally enthusiastic developers is something I really wanted. A technical blog? Yes and more than that, a learning medium for all of us.

Now this blog is for you if:
1. You're an amateur like me and you want to read about probably the most simple projects I undertake.
2. You want to have a look into the field of software development from a model's perspective.
3. Thats it.. how many more reasons do you need?

So Lets Code Away!


I might get late with my posts but if you need me I will be here perfecting my cat eye. :)
